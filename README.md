# Personal Budgeting Application V1
An App that allows users to create and manage a personal budget based on the Envelope Budgeting system.

I wont spend too much time explaining the app here as it is the first prototype. There are many improvments that could be made to this project but don't want to spend too much time coding logic for things that could be handled by other parts of the app (HTML forms and a database). This project was created for practice using Express routers and will soon be recreated with a PostgreSQL database and possibly a React.js frontend. I will post the link for the new version of the project here soon and will simply keep this repo as a reminder of how far my skills have come.
